## Overview
The [TERMinator suite repository](https://github.com/momalab/TERMinatorSuite) offers benchmarks specifically tailored to encrypted computers, to enable comparisons across different architectures.
The original Terminator suite targeted partially homomorphic architectures.
However, since its release, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) has become increasingly popular and more viable.
To account for this, Terminator 2 targets FHE architectures by modifying the original benchmarks as well as adding new additions that represent realistic use cases.
